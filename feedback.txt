It was an interesting exercise. I struggled to understand exactly some tasks were requiring.
For 2e it is a little unclear whether I am allowed to change the timer A0 period or not.
The last sentence of 2e is also a little misleading to me, it gives the impression that it should not be
overheating anymore, but since I am not allowed to change where my controller is running, 
it will always cause overheating by the deadlock.
