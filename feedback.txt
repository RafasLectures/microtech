It was straight forward. 

I created the GPIO and Timer headers so in the future I don't need to worry about
the whole IO setup and Timer counter calculations. It would be faster to do the next exercises, I think.

I struggled in one point where I want to have the interruptions and callback functions encapsulated within the object "managing" a resource
(like GPIO or Timer). The way it is done now seems a little like a hack to me. I hope
I come up with a better way of doing in the near future.

Some ideas for the future is to have a googletest setup where you could have your own msp430g2553 header mocking the real implementation.
We could then write our software and test in our machine to make sure we are setting the correct registers approapriately. 
Also we could have a GitHub classroom with an action that would basically run those tests. It would also give an impression to the students
about git, and Continuous integration pipeline.
