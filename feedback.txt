It was very straight forward. The part I struggled the most was to use the DTC from the ADC10.
I had the impression that it would work like a DMA, and directly trigger the next ADC conversions after all
of the ADC channels were read and written in to the desired addresses, but apparently there is still the need to request the ADC to start the conversion.

I thought that because I configured the AD to be "Repeat sequence-of-channels", but it didn't work... If you know how to make it I would be glad to learn.

I liked to use the DTC, since it requires no CPU to put the conversion to the "meaninful" memory addresses.

I had no problems while solving the exercise apart from being ill for a week.
