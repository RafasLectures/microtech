It was straight forward. 

I created the GPIO and Timer headers so in the future I don't need to worry about
the whole IO setup and Timer counter calculations. It would be faster to do the next exercises, I think.

I struggled in one point where I want to have callback functions encapsulated within the object "managing" a resource
(like GPIO or Timer). The way it is done now seems a little like a hack to me. I hope
I come up with a better way of doing in the near future.
