1.b) Advantages:
	1. The voltage follower circuit has a high input impedence, while the input pin has a 20kOhm to 50kOhm input impedance (according to datasheet page 24) from the the pull-down resistor.
	   Higher impedance is better for a voltage input.
	   
	2. The voltage comparator circuit allows us to adjust the voltage threshold for detecting a vibration with the potentiometer P1.
	
	Signal flow:
	The BUZZER is connected to the common of the relay. The normally close (NC) is connected to the DAC_IN, so whenever the relay is off (REL_STAT = 0), the value from
	the BUZZER goes to the voltage follower (DAC_IN), and its output goes to the voltage comparator. The reference voltage is defined by the value of the voltage drop in P1.
	When there is a vibration, there is a voltage in DAC_IN, causing the voltage follower to input a voltage in the voltage comparator. If this voltage is bigger than the threshold,
	the COMP_OUT goes to 1. This triggers a pin interrupt and the software disables the interrupt of that pin, and turns on the relay (REL_STAT = 1)
	in which connects the BUZZER to the normally closed (NC) contact (connected to the PWM pin).
	The song play and as soon as the song is done, the relay is powered off (REL_STAT = 0) and after 250ms the software re-enables the COMP_OUT pin interrupt.
	
	To turn on the relay, the ransistor T1 is polarized (gate of T1 goes to HIGH).
